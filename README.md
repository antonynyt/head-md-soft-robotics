# Soft Robotics
**Partners: CNRS, CEA, INRIA**

As our planet faces accelerating ecological crises, robotics offers new ways of perceiving, sensing, and interacting with the environment. Moving beyond efficiency and automation, this workshop explores soft, ecological, and sensitive robots. We will think of robots as sensitive machines that might decompose, recycle, breathe, or sense pollution and debris.

## Brief

Students will develop prototypes of soft ecological robots, from non-functional to semi-functional mock-ups. These artefacts will combine organic motion with environmental functions such as recycling, sensing, filtering, or decomposition.
